# AssetRental Smart Contract

## 🚀 Project Title
Renting Smart Contract (Houses, Cars, Assets)

## 📘 Project Description
This smart contract enables decentralized renting of various assets such as houses, cars, and other valuable property on the Ethereum blockchain. Owners can list assets for rent, and users can rent them for a specified number of days with transparent and secure transactions.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To revolutionize traditional rental systems by eliminating intermediaries, enhancing transparency, reducing fraud, and enabling peer-to-peer rentals directly on the blockchain.

## 🔑 Key Features:
- **Decentralized Rental Listing**: Owners can add assets available for rent.
- **Secure Payments**: Renters pay in Ether directly through the smart contract.
- **Asset Management**: Ensures only available assets can be rented and returns assets back to inventory after use.

## 🌐 Future Scope
- Support for ERC-20 or stablecoin payments.
- Integration with off-chain metadata for asset descriptions.
- Time-based auto return or auto-renewal mechanisms.
- Role-based access for different user types (owners, renters, admins).
- Cross-chain compatibility for multi-chain rentals.
- Frontend DApp with wallet integration for usability.
